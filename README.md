# opbot

OpBot is a discord bot for testing servers, to allow you **any user in the guild** to remove and add a specific role.
This is useful when testing things like AutoMod.

You can invite OpBot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1117836266487156766&permissions=268435456&scope=bot).
Make sure to move its role above the role configured in `/setup`.
